## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository will contain the official implementation of **LEVIO**, a lightweight embedded Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) system designed for **resource-constrained devices** such as microcontrollers, and ultra low-power Systems on Chip (SoCs).

The release will include:
- **An optimized implementation for the GAP9 SoC** by [GreenWaves Technologies](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies)
- **A golden model** used for algorithm development and evaluation in the accompanying paper

**LEVIO** is designed with:
- **Minimal memory footprint**
- **Low computational overhead** leveraging parallelization
- **Real-time performance** on ultra-low power embedded devices

Our approach targets applications where traditional VIO solutions are too heavy to run, enabling precise motion estimation for **IoT**, **wearable devices**, **mobile robotics**, and **AR/VR on embedded systems**.

## ðŸ“… Availability

The complete source code and documentation will be made publicly available **together with the paper submission**.
